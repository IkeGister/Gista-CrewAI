# Gista-CrewAI API Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure you've completed all necessary steps before deploying the Gista-CrewAI API with the enhanced auto-create gist functionality.

## Security Preparation

- [ ] Run the security check script to identify potential security issues:
  ```bash
  python check_security.py
  ```

- [ ] Remove sensitive information from the codebase:
  - [ ] API keys
  - [ ] Firebase credentials
  - [ ] Service account keys
  - [ ] Passwords
  - [ ] Authentication tokens

- [ ] Ensure sensitive files are in `.gitignore`:
  - [ ] `.env`
  - [ ] `service-account.json`
  - [ ] Any other files containing credentials

- [ ] Create a secure deployment package:
  ```bash
  ./prepare_for_deployment.sh
  ```

## Environment Configuration

- [ ] Set up environment variables in your production environment:
  - [ ] AI service keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
  - [ ] CrewAI backend service configuration
  - [ ] Firebase configuration
  - [ ] API URLs

- [ ] Configure Firebase service account:
  - [ ] Securely store the service account JSON file
  - [ ] Set up appropriate permissions

## Testing

- [ ] Run all tests to ensure functionality:
  ```bash
  ./run_all_tests.sh
  ```

- [ ] Verify the auto-create gist functionality:
  - [ ] Test with `auto_create_gist=true`
  - [ ] Test with `auto_create_gist=false`

- [ ] Test in a staging environment that mirrors production

## Deployment

- [ ] Deploy to Firebase Functions:
  ```bash
  cd deployment-package
  firebase deploy --only functions
  ```

- [ ] Verify the deployment:
  - [ ] Test the API endpoints
  - [ ] Check logs for any errors
  - [ ] Monitor performance

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting:
  - [ ] Configure error alerts
  - [ ] Set up performance monitoring
  - [ ] Monitor API usage

- [ ] Document the deployment:
  - [ ] Update API documentation
  - [ ] Document any changes to response formats
  - [ ] Update client integration guides

- [ ] Create a rollback plan in case of issues

## Security Best Practices

- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys
- [ ] Audit access to the Firebase project
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews

## Final Verification

- [ ] Verify all endpoints are working as expected
- [ ] Confirm the auto-create gist functionality is working correctly
- [ ] Check that error handling is working properly
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass in the production environment
